# hi! i'm dan.

if you're here, you somehow found yourself on a random boring old github profile.
here's what i do:
 - graphic designer
 - former community manager @ wilbursoot
 - python dev (i guess?)
 
where can you find me? well, i'm glad you asked! i design [here](https://pixelflow.xyz). that's about it.

see you around!
